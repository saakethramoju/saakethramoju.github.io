# FullFlow

FullFlow is a Python framework for fluid, thermal, and propulsion network simulation.

It provides a component-based architecture for constructing and solving engineering systems composed of interconnected fluid, thermal, combustion, turbomachinery, and heat-transfer elements.

FullFlow is inspired by tools such as:

* ROCETS
* GFSSP
* NPSS
* EcosimPro

while remaining fully open-source and Python-native.

## Why FullFlow?

Engineering systems are often modeled as networks:

* Fluid networks
* Thermal networks
* Feed systems
* Propulsion systems
* Turbomachinery systems
* Heat exchanger systems
* Regenerative cooling systems
* Coupled fluid-thermal systems

Traditional network solvers are frequently proprietary, difficult to extend, or difficult to integrate into modern Python workflows.

FullFlow allows engineers to construct simulation networks directly in Python using reusable components and shared states.

For example:

```python
from fullflow import *

FeedSystem = Network("Feed System")

SourcePressure = State(5e5)
TankPressure = State(3e5)

FeedLine = DarcyWeisbach(
    "Feed Line",
    FeedSystem,
    upstream_pressure=SourcePressure,
    downstream_pressure=TankPressure,
)

solution = SteadyState(FeedSystem).solve()
```

## Features

* Component-based network architecture
* Steady-state network solver
* Fluid, thermal, and propulsion modeling

## Installation

## Core Concepts

FullFlow models engineering systems using three primary concepts:

### Network

A `Network` contains the complete engineering system.

Networks manage:

* Components
* States
* Tracking variables
* Solver interactions

```python
NetworkModel = Network("Example System")
```

### State

A `State` represents a simulation variable.

Examples include:

* Pressure
* Temperature
* Mass flow rate
* Enthalpy
* Heat rate
* Rotor speed

```python
Pressure = State(5e5)
Temperature = State(300)
```

### Component

A `Component` represents a physical device, process, or relationship.

Examples include:

* Pipes
* Valves
* Pumps
* Tanks
* Heat transfer elements
* Sensors
* Fluid property models

Components define equations that contribute to the overall network solution.

## Solvers

### SteadyState

The `SteadyState` solver computes a converged operating point for the network.

```python
solution = SteadyState(NetworkModel).solve()
```

### Transient

Transient simulation capabilities are under active development.

Branch components model transport processes between nodes.

Examples include:

* Darcy-Weisbach flow elements
* Discharge coefficients

## Examples

### Pump-Fed Rocket Engine

FullFlow can be used to model complete liquid rocket propulsion systems, including pressurization systems, tanks, pumps, injector manifolds, combustion chambers, and nozzles.

Run the example:

```bash
uv run python examples/pump_fed_engine.py
```

```python
from fullflow import *

PumpNetwork = Network("Pumped System")

fuel_shaft_speed = State(25000)
ox_shaft_speed = State(25000)

FuelTankFluid = FluidLookup(...)
OxTankFluid = FluidLookup(...)

FuelPump = PolytropicPump(...)
OxPump = PolytropicPump(...)

MainChamber = MainCombustionChamber(...)
Nozzle = RocketCEAChokedNozzle(...)

solution = SteadyState(PumpNetwork).solve()
```

See `examples/pump_fed_engine.py` for the complete model.

### Mixture Splitter

FullFlow supports fluid mixtures, composition tracking, mixing, and separation.

Run the example:

```bash
uv run python examples/mixture_splitter.py
```

```python
from fullflow import *

SourceFluid = FluidLookup(
    "Source Fluid",
    MixtureNetwork,
    {"gn2": 0.75, "O2": 0.01, "Ar": 0.24},
    pressure=3e5,
    temperature=300,
)

Separator = FlowSplitter(
    "Separator",
    MixtureNetwork,
    pressure=VolumeFluid.pressure,
    composition=VolumeFluid.composition,
    composition_out1=SeparatorOutlet1Composition,
    composition_out2=SeparatorOutlet2Composition,
)

solution = SteadyState(MixtureNetwork).solve()
```

This example demonstrates:

* Multicomponent fluid mixtures
* Composition tracking
* Flow splitting
* Composition balances
* Mixture thermodynamic property evaluation

See `examples/mixture_splitter.py` for the complete model.

### Counterflow Heat Exchanger

FullFlow supports coupled fluid and thermal simulations, allowing heat exchangers to be modeled using fluid networks, thermal networks, material properties, and heat-transfer correlations within a unified framework.

Run the example:

```bash
uv run python examples/heat_exchanger.py
```

```python
from fullflow import *

HeatExchanger = Network("Heat Exchanger")

LiquidSource = FluidLookup(
    "Liquid Source",
    HeatExchanger,
    "rp-1",
    pressure=6e5,
    temperature=1000,
)

CoolantSource = FluidLookup(
    "Coolant Source",
    HeatExchanger,
    "water",
    pressure=20e5,
    temperature=300,
)

TubeNode1 = Solid(...)
TubeNode2 = Solid(...)

TubeConduction = Conduction(...)

Liquid1Solid1Convection = Convection(...)
Coolant2Solid1Convection = Convection(...)

HeatTransferModel = Model(
    "Heat Transfer Correlation",
    HeatExchanger,
    GnielinskiOption,
    DittusBoelterOption,
)

solution = SteadyState(HeatExchanger).solve(
    model="Heat Transfer Correlation"
)
```

This example demonstrates:

* Counterflow heat exchanger modeling
* Coupled fluid and thermal networks
* Temperature-dependent material properties
* Conduction and convection
* Internal and annular flow passages
* Gnielinski and Dittus-Boelter heat-transfer correlations
* Model switching with `Model` and `ModelOption`

See `examples/heat_exchanger.py` for the complete model.

### Model Comparison and Correlation Sweeps

FullFlow supports interchangeable physics models through `Model` and `ModelOption`.

This allows multiple component formulations to be evaluated within the same network without rebuilding the system.

Run the example:

```bash
uv run python examples/model_comparison.py
```

```python
from fullflow import *

PumpModel = Model(
    "Main Pump",
    PumpNetwork,
    ConstantDensityPumpOption,
    PolytropicPumpOption,
)

solution = SteadyState(PumpNetwork).solve(
    model="Main Pump",
    evaluate_all_model_options=True,
)
```

This example demonstrates:

* Model switching
* Alternative component formulations
* Pump-model comparison
* Shared turbomachinery maps
* Correlation sweeps
* Automated evaluation of multiple model options

See `examples/model_comparison.py` for the complete model.
